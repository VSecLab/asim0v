Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design and that the compartmentalization serves to allow for and further reinforce privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide when it is appropriate to use and to drop system privileges.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience, and nobody else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic and not being cryptic enough. They should not necessarily reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Such detailed information can be used to refine the original attack to increase the chances of success. If errors must be tracked in some detail, capture them in log messages - but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Avoid recording highly sensitive information such as passwords in any form. Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a username is valid or not.::","description":"The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.","x_status":"Incomplete","x_related_attack_patterns":"","x_affected_resources":"","x_detection_methods":"","x_taxonomy_mappings":"::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Discrepancy Information Leaks::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2007:ENTRY ID:A6:ENTRY NAME:Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A7:ENTRY NAME:Improper Error Handling:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::","x_related_weaknesses":"::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:200:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:200:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::","x_background_details":"","x_exploitation_factors":"","x_applicable_platforms":"::LANGUAGE CLASS:Language-Independent:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Technology-Independent:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::","x_alternate_terms":"::TERM:Side Channel Attack:DESCRIPTION:Observable Discrepancies are at the root of class of attacks known as side channel attacks.::","x_notes":"","x_modes_of_introduction":"::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::","x_common_consequences":"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:An attacker can gain access to sensitive information about the system, including authentication information that may allow an attacker to gain access to the system.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:Crypto primitives being vulnerable to side-channel-attacks could render the supposedly encrypted data unencrypted plaintext in the worst case.
