Intro
Please refer to my thesis Automated Penetration Testing driven by  Cyber Threat Intelligence for which you can find below an excerpt from the abstract

"In this dissertation, we start giving a brief overview of basic security concepts, to then 
focus on penetration testing. We explore different security related sources of information 
provided by MITRE organization and how they can be aggregated to create a unique 
reference for both humans and machines, using a standard format for reporting Cyber 
Threat Intelligence using the STIX expression language. And starting from there we define 
our own workflow, taking leverage of the famous security tool Metasploit, in particular 
using its fork from Praetorian company. 
All our effort will be delivered as a new tool for Automated Security Intelligence 
Management for Zero Vulnerability, named ASIM0V, hopefully a starting point for the 
next students, that can focus in testing different targets, and also consolidating and 
expanding its features."


The repo also contains CVE, CWE, CAPEC and ATT&CK data.
